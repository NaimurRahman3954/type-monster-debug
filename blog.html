            <h3>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h3>
            <p>
               The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.

            <h3>What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
            <p>
               The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.

            <h3>How does JavaScript event loop work?</h3>
            <p>
               JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.               Find out more from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop">MDN</a>.

            <h3>How many ways do we get undefined?</h3>
            <p> undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.
               In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)
               A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
